# Biography

Michael Schmidt is a senior lecturer in the theory group at the University of New South Wales Sydney. His research interests include neutrino physics, dark matter, flavour physics and in general physics beyond the Standard Model.

He has mainly worked on models of neutrino mass generation both in the context of grand unified theories and radiative neutrino mass models. He studied possible flavour symmetries which may explain the leptonic mixing as well as the renormalization group evolution of leptonic mixing angles and neutrino masses. Apart from that he worked on models adressing the question why the electroweak scale is so much lighter than the scale of grand unification or the Planck scale which is commonly known as the hierarchy problem: This includes scale-invariant models and the (next-to) minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. Currently his research activities are focussed on (lepton) flavour physics, dark matter and neutrino physics.
